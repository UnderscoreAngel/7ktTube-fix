# 7ktTube-fix
a fix for 7kttube (descontinued)

so this is the code release of my "7ktTube Fix" since im discontinuing it, i know it's really bad written and it's just
spaguetti code, but it might help someone i guess, keep reading i have a couple of things to say

i lastly want to apologize to this subreddit, if i ever insulted someone's "revival site" i don't like these because i've
simply had bad experiences with them, but they do seem like a fun idea and i am aware that there are good moderated sites 
that do a pretty good job, i've probably shouldn't have been to hard on some users, i also want to talk about the stuff
with the rehike developers, first i want to make clear that i don't have a problem with rehike itself, it's a good idea
really well executed and it's really well coded, the problem is their developers, and the problem goes more deeper than them
insulting my "Windows setup" or whatever, it goes to the simple core issue that they think they are better than everyone else
that's all, and also, i just don't go along with them, i'm just saying all of this because they said that all that i bring
to this community is just arguments and that i help with nothing, and that's probably true, the thing is that i actively try to
help with what i can, maybe i seem like a toxic person to them, but what they have done, to me, it seems so much worse
