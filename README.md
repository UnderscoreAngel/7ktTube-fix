# 7ktTube-fix
a fix for 7kttube (descontinued)

so this is the code release of my "7ktTube Fix" since im discontinuing it, i know it's really bad written and it's just
spaguetti code, but it might help someone i guess, keep reading i have a couple of things to say

i lastly want to apologize to this subreddit, if i ever insulted someone's "revival site" i don't like these because i've
simply had bad experiences with them, but they do seem like a fun idea and i am aware that there are good moderated sites 
that do a pretty good job, i've probably shouldn't have been to hard on some users.
